		<h4> Financial/Cost Background: </h4>
		<p> The entire cost of making our product, TS Lift UP! will cost one dollar and the reason for this is due to mass production in China. The factories that we made deals with have enough capacity and power in mass producing our product that we can scale the business to however big we want to get. The cost of one TS Lift-UP! being sold in the market is at $39.99 and consumers can get an offer of two TS Lift-UP! for the price of $70.00. We believe in our company that accessibility to our product is key in helping our customers solve their toilet problems at home, so our prices are geared towards this philosophy of ours.

	Our goal when we created 'TS Lift Up' six years ago was the same as it is today: to prevent and alleviate family's discomfort in a place that you are supposed to feel safe. Your day ends and starts in the bathroom why start an issue when a could be evaded. The product is made to build a sense of transparency between men and women within their homes when it comes to using the bathroom. Furthermore, as we stated in the beginning of this proposal we are here with a revolutionary idea that will solve millions of people and solve a huge social problem between men and women alike.
